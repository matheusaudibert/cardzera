# Cardzera

Generates a custom card for your Discord server, designed to be embedded in your GitHub README or any other platform. It visually displays your server info, making it easy to share and invite others.

_This project is inspired in [lanyard-profile-readme](https://github.com/cnrad/lanyard-profile-readme) by [@cnrad](https://github.com/cnrad), that generates a discord user card by. Thx!_

## How it works

The service uses [Cardzera#8965](https://discord.com/users/1368283106276147200) (a discord bot) to fetch server information through Discord's API. When you provide a server ID, the bot (which needs to be in your server) retrieves details like:

- Server name
- Server icon
- Member count
- Online members count

Then, it generates a beautifully styled card showing this information that you can embed anywhere. The generated card is an SVG image optimized for fast loading and can be fully customized with your preferred colors and style.

### Prerequisites

1. First, [invite Cardzera Bot to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1368283106276147200&permissions=525312&integration_type=0&scope=bot).
2. The bot needs to be in your server to access its information. Required permissions:

   - View Channels - To access server information
   - View Server Insights - To get member statistics
   - Members Intent - To count online members

> [!TIP]
> Get your server ID (Enable Developer Mode > Right click server > Copy ID)
